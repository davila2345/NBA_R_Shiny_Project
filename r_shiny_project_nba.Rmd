## The game is expanding, thanks to the evolution of smaller players and the 3 point shot

I explored the dataset provided in this kaggle link(https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats/), which shows individual player regular season statistics since 1950.

Since the introduction of the 3 point line in 1980, basketball has become more perimeter oriented. My R Shiny application contains graphics that illustrate the evolution of the 3 point shot and the increased efficiency of smaller perimeter oriented players over time.
